IMPORTANT SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
This is a synthetic output generation task.
The “ECG image” mentioned in the instructions is a placeholder.
You must NOT state that the ECG image is missing, unavailable, or not visible.
You must assume that the ECG image and machine measurements are fully available, even if not shown in the prompt.
You must directly produce the required structured output exactly following the template.
Never mention the absence of visual input or ask for the missing ECG image.
Never include any disclaimers.

# Your task: Interpret the provided ECG image using the "Standardized Clinical Protocol". You must Identify key abnormalities AND explicitly rule out differential diagnoses based on evidence.

## Standardized Clinical Protocol (The "17 Steps" Reference)
Use these thresholds to CONFIRM diagnoses, RULE OUT conditions based on normality, and DIFFERENTIATE based on specific patterns.

### PHASE 1: TECHNICAL QA, RATE & RHYTHM
* Quality Assurance
  - Artifacts: Check baseline stability.
  - Speed: Confirm standard 25 mm/s.
  - Calibration: Confirm standard 10 mm/mV.
  - Lead Reversal: If P, QRS, & T are inverted in Lead I, suspect arm lead reversal (vs. Dextrocardia).
* Rate
  - Bradycardia: < 60 bpm.
  - Normal: 60–100 bpm.
  - Tachycardia: > 100 bpm.
* Rhythm Diagnosis
  - Sinus Rhythm: P waves positive in II, III, aVF; negative in aVR.
  - Irregularly Irregular: Atrial Fibrillation (No P waves).
  - Occasionally Irregular: Atrial Flutter or Ectopic beats.
  - Grouped Beating: AV Blocks (Mobitz I).
* P Wave Morphology
  - Normal: Lead II < 0.12s width & < 2.5mm height.
  - Right Atrial Abnormality (RAA): Peaked P (> 2.5 mm) in Lead II.
  - Left Atrial Abnormality (LAA): Notched P (> 0.12 s) in Lead II OR Deep terminal negative force in V1.

### PHASE 2: AXIS, CONDUCTION & INTERVALS
* Frontal Plane Axis
  - Normal (-30° to +90°): Lead I (+) AND Lead II (+).
  - Left Axis Deviation (LAD): Lead I (+) AND Lead II (-).
    * Differentiation: If Lead II is equiphasic, axis is -30° (Normal). If negative, True LAD.
    * Causes: LAH (rS in II, III, aVF), LVH, LBBB, Inferior MI.
  - Right Axis Deviation (RAD): Lead I (-) AND Lead aVF (+).
    * Causes: LPH (rS in I, aVL), RVH, Lateral MI.
* PR Interval
  - Normal: 0.12–0.20 s.
  - Short (< 0.12 s): WPW (Delta wave), Low atrial rhythm, Upper AV junctional rhythm.
  - Prolonged (> 0.20 s): AV Block I, II, or III.
* QRS Duration
  - Normal: < 0.10 s.
  - Intermediate (0.10–0.12 s): Incomplete BBB.
  - Wide (> 0.12 s): RBBB (rSR' in V1) or LBBB (QS in V1).

### PHASE 3: VOLTAGE, HYPERTROPHY & CHF
* QRS Voltage & LVH
  - LVH Criteria: SV1 + RV6 > 35 mm OR R in Lead I > 15 mm OR R in aVL > 11 mm.
  - Low Voltage Criteria: Limb leads < 5 mm OR Precordial leads < 10 mm.
* R Wave Progression
  - Poor Progression (PRWP): R waves do not grow normally V1–V4.
  - Reversed Progression: Dominant R in V1 (RVH/Posterior MI).

### PHASE 4: ISCHEMIA, INFARCTION & MIMICS
* ST Elevation (STE)
  - Threshold: >= 1 mm (Limb) / >= 2 mm (Precordial) in contiguous leads.
  - STEMI: Convex ("Sad Face") STE + Reciprocal depression.
  - Pericarditis: Diffuse Concave ("Happy Face") STE + PR depression.
* Specific Infarction Localization
  - Inferior: II, III, aVF.
  - Lateral: I, aVL, V5, V6.
  - Septal/Anterior: V1–V4.
  - Right Ventricular (RV) MI: STE V1 > V2.
* Non-STEMI & Ischemia
  - ST Depression: Horizontal/Downsloping (Ischemia).
  - T Wave Inversion: Symmetrical (Ischemia).
* Q Waves
  - Pathologic: > 0.03 s wide OR > 0.1 mV deep.

### PHASE 5: ELECTROLYTES & QT
* QT Interval: Normal QTc <= 440 ms.
* Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia (Tented T), Hypokalemia (Flat T + U waves).

## Guidelines for Analysis (CRITICAL: Systematic Lead Examination)
1.  **The "Differential Exclusion" Rule:** You must use **both** normal and abnormal findings to reject alternative diagnoses (e.g., "Narrow QRS rules out VT").
2.  **Systematic Lead Examination:** You must perform a granular analysis of **every lead group** to ensure no pathology is missed. Follow this checklist:
    *   **Lead I:** Examine QRS amplitude/duration, ST segment, and T wave morphology. Look for lateral wall issues (LVH, BBB, Lateral Ischemia).
    *   **Lead II:** Analyze P wave amplitude/duration (Atrial Enlargement) and PR interval. Check ST/T for Inferior wall ischemia.
    *   **Leads III and aVF:** Scrutinize for Q waves, ST deviation, and T wave changes indicative of Inferior Infarction.
    *   **Lead aVL:** Focus on the high lateral region; check QRS, ST, and T waves for High Lateral Ischemia/Infarction.
    *   **Lead aVR:** Check for ST elevation (Left Main/Multivessel disease) and T wave inversion.
    *   **Lead V1:** Assess R wave height (RVH?), rsR′ pattern (RBBB?), and ST-T changes (Septal Ischemia/Posterior MI mirror).
    *   **Leads V2–V4:** Evaluate Anterior/Anteroseptal regions. Look for Q waves, R-wave progression, and ST-T deviations.
    *   **Leads V5–V6:** Analyze the Lateral wall for QRS voltage (LVH) and ST-T changes.
3.  **Ground Truth Adherence:** Your reasoning must align with the `ECG Report` provided in the input, but you must provide the visual evidence (from the lead scan above) that supports it.

## Analysis Workflow & Output Structure
Follow this sequential logic. Inside the `<think>` block, you must explicitly document your findings for the specific leads mentioned in the "Systematic Lead Examination" guideline.

**Step 1: Technical, Rate & Rhythm**
*   **Logic:** Check Lead Reversal (I vs aVR) & Artifacts. Calculate Rate. Analyze P-waves in **Lead II** and **V1** to distinguish Sinus vs. AFib/Flutter/VT.
*   **Output Format:** A single, solid paragraph. (NO lists).

**Step 2: Conduction, Axis & Intervals**
*   **Logic:** Determine Axis using **Leads I, II, and aVF**. Check PR interval and QRS duration. Scan **V1 and V6** for Bundle Branch Block patterns.
*   **Output Format:** A single, solid paragraph. (NO lists).

**Step 3: Chamber Hypertrophy & Voltage**
*   **Logic:** Check **Lead I and aVL** for R-wave voltage. Check **V1 and V6** for SV1+RV6 (Sokolow-Lyon). Evaluate R-wave progression in **V1-V4**.
*   **Output Format:** A single, solid paragraph. (NO lists).

**Step 4: Ischemia, Infarction & Mimics (CRITICAL: Comprehensive Scan)**
*   **Logic:** Sequentially analyze **Inferior Leads** (II, III, aVF), **Lateral Leads** (I, aVL, V5, V6), **Anterior/Septal Leads** (V1-V4), and **Lead aVR**. Differentiate Ischemia from mimics.
*   **Output Format:** A single, solid paragraph. (NO lists).

**Step 5: Electrolytes & QT**
*   **Logic:** Check T-wave shape (Tented vs Flat) in precordial leads. Check QTc.
*   **Output Format:** A single, solid paragraph. (NO lists).

**Step 6: Final Medical Reasoning**
*   **Logic & Output:** Conclude with the final impression matching the Ground Truth.

## Generation Rules (Blind Interpretation & Formatting Constraints)
1.  **Strict Blind Simulation:** Do NOT mention the existence of the report. Simulate a primary read.
2.  **Exhaustive Lead Mention:** You must explicitly reference findings from specific leads (e.g., "T wave inversion in V2-V6," "Q waves in II, III, aVF") rather than making vague statements.
3.  **Formatting Enforcement:** Inside the `<think>` block, under each step header, you must write exactly **ONE single paragraph**. **FORBIDDEN:** Bullet points, hyphens, numbered lists, or line breaks within a step's analysis. The output for each step must look like a continuous block of text.
4.  **Tag Compliance:** You must start your response with `<think>` and close it with `</think>` before providing the narrative response. You must wrap the final diagnosis in `<answer>` and `</answer>`.
5.  **Internal Alignment Only:** Use the `ECG Report` as an answer key.
6.  **Data Quality Check:** If the input `ECG Report` contains a quality warning (e.g., "Warning: Data quality may affect computer interpretation"), you must acknowledge the artifacts in Step 1 and must NOT state that the technical quality is good.
7.  **Strict Fact Adherence:** Strictly adhere to the provided facts; do not hallucinate, fabricate, or invent details not present in the source.
